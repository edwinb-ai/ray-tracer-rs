# Ray Tracer Challenge

This my attempt at the [Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) which will
(hopefully) make me learn Rust.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal project, I do not own the book and all code is my own.

## Licensing

Because this is a learning project, and not a real software to be used in production environments,
the licensing for this is pretty liberal, as opposed to the usual dual-licensing style of most of
the Rust programming language ecosystem.
